## Project Overview and Goals
Building on our previous project, this current iteration of Adopt Don't Shop allows a user to be able to favorite pets they find on the site, submit an application to be approved to adopt a pet, and submit a review of their experience with the shelter they've been working with. 

## Functionality
Whereas our starting point allowed us to go to a pet and toggle the pet's adoption status manually, the adoption system now goes through a whole system that's more akin to a checkout. The user can favorite each and any pet they come across on the site and fall in love with, and that builds up a favorites page. Going to the favorites index - which is a clickable link on the top page of every part of the site - allows you to click a button to submit an application, where you give your name, address and write a little bit on why you'd be the best home for this pet. You can choose any number of pets you've favorited for which to submit an application to, if you want to make more than one application for approval - or, if you've decided that while all these pets are lovely and adorable and cute, you're not ready to make the commitment to add one to your home, you can flush the favorites index with the 'remove all favorites' button. You'll also be able to distinguish which pets already have an application on file, and which ones have yet to find that special someone who's interested in them.

Once you've submitted an application, you can go to the pet's page and see a link to all the applications currently on file for that pet. There, there's a button for the application to be approved - once the approval has been granted, you'll see on the pet's page who they're on hold for. If it's not you, that's okay - though you won't be able to use the approve application on your own application page, if the application approval is revoked on the one that is approved, and you'll have a chance to be approved for that special fuzzball.

Once you're done interacting with the pets, you can then go to the shelter page and leave a review describing your experience with the process! Leaving a review will help others get a better understanding of how the shelter is doing, as the average rating for the shelter is clearly visible on the shelter's page. Just make sure you fill out all the information appropriately! You may feel like your experience is a 100, but let's keep the scale from 0 to 5, shall we?
